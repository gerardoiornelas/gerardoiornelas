### Hi, I’m Gerardo 👋

I’m a builder who cares deeply about **secure systems**, **clean architecture**, and **making complex things usable**.  
I work at the intersection of **encryption**, **developer experience**, and **product design**.

Most of my work lives inside private infrastructure, but I’m steadily open-sourcing
small tools, patterns, and ideas that other developers can use.

---

### 🔭 What I’m currently focused on
- Building **Qripton**, a security layer designed to make encryption effortless and repeatable  
- Improving **developer workflows** around serverless, Python, and TypeScript  
- Exploring **zero-knowledge proofs**, **identity-bound encryption**, and **stateless key systems**

---

### 🛠️ Tools I work with often
- **Languages:** Python, TypeScript, Go (learning), Bash  
- **Cloud:** AWS (SAM, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudFront, Cognito)  
- **Frameworks:** React, FastAPI, Vite, CDK, Node tooling  
- **Security:** key management, signature workflows, encryption pipelines, ZK fundamentals  
- **DevOps:** GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines, IaC, containerized local development  

---

### 📦 Highlighted Work
While most of my engineering happens in secure environments, I occasionally publish
lightweight open-source projects, examples, and prototypes:

- **Secure Document Exchange Demo**  
  Small reference implementation showing how to build a secure upload → encrypt → transmit workflow.

- **Python Serverless Patterns**  
  A collection of AWS Lambda + SAM examples for Python developers.

- **Front-end Sampling Projects**  
  Experiments with UX for security, React component patterns, and simple design systems.

(If you’re reading this early — more repos are coming soon.)

### 🧭 What I care about as an engineer
- Making **security usable**  
- Clear naming, clean folder structure, and code that ages well  
- Reducing complexity where possible  
- Designing APIs that “feel obvious”  
- Shipping over showmanship  
- Systems that scale because the *architecture* is simple, not because the cloud bill is huge

---

### 🤝 How I like to collaborate
I enjoy working with developers who:
- Ask “why” as much as “how”
- Love sharpening tools, not just building features
- Care about reliability, correctness, and clarity
- Can balance **product thinking** with **technical rigor**

If that sounds like you, feel free to reach out.

### 🌱 Currently exploring
- ZK learning path (math foundations + Python toolchain)  
- Event-driven encryption pipelines  
- Developer-first cryptography education  
- How to make secure defaults feel effortless to implement

### ⚡ A small thing about me
I love technology that balances **precision, craft, and design** — whether it’s elegant code,
well-made tools, or a perfectly engineered mechanical watch.
