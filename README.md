### Hi, I’m Gerardo 👋

I’m a builder who cares deeply about **secure systems**, **clean architecture**, and **making complex things usable**.  
I work at the intersection of **encryption**, **developer experience**, and **product design**.

Most of my work lives inside private infrastructure, but I’m steadily open-sourcing
small tools, patterns, and ideas that other developers can use.
